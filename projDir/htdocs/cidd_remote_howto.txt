HOWTO for using CIDD remotely for FRONT
=======================================

1. Download CIDD binary
-----------------------

There are 2 binary distributions for LINUX, one for 64-bit hosts and
one for 32-bit hosts.

You can find these at:

  https://www.eol.ucar.edu/software/cidd-cartesian-interactive-data-display

Download the relevant tar file. For example, for 64-bit hosts, the
version for 2014/05/13 is:

  cidd-20140513.x86_64.tgz

2. Install CIDD binary
----------------------

Make yourself a staging directory and copy the file in.

For example:

  mkdir ~/cidd_dist
  cd cidd_dist
  cp ~/Downloads/cidd-20140513.x86_64.tgz .

Untar the file:

  tar xvfz cidd-20140513.x86_64.tgz

Go into the directory:

  cd cidd-20140513.x86_64

By default, the binaries will be installed in /usr/local/bin.
To do this, you will need to use sudo, or be root. For example:

  sudo ./install_bin_release

If you want to put it in your local area, instead of /usr/local,
choose a target location, for example ~/bin.

Then install the binary as follows:

  ./install_bin_release ~/bin

In this case, make sure ~/bin is in your path.

Check that you can run CIDD, by running the following:

  rehash (if you use csh or tcsh)
  CIDD -help

and you should see something like the following:

  Usage:CIDD [-p Parameter_file] [-v report_level] [-i Instance string] \[-t YYYYMMDDHHMM(SS - seconds optional)] [-h height,height,height,...  ] [-x http://proxy_host:3128] \ [-print_params] 

       -p: CIDD will look for config files in dir where param file  is located
       -v: Level 0-7 Verbosity (Bitwise flags)
       -h: CIDD starts up at the first height
       -i: CIDD registers with the process mapper using this instance
       -q: Quiet mode: CIDD outputs no messages 
       -t: CIDD Starts up in archive mode at this time
       -u: CIDD runs unmapped (hidden)
       -x: Use this proxy server for data requests
       -V: Run in vertical pointing mode - no cosine correction)
       -print_params: Output a default/example param file

If you do, your installation is successful.

Then hit Ctrl-C to exit CIDD.

3. Set up the X environment for CIDD fonts
------------------------------------------

Go to:

  https://www.eol.ucar.edu/content/display-tools

Expand the "Files and Brochures' tab at the top.

Download the file:

  XResources4CIDD.txt

move the file to a convenient location, and then set your display font
resources using the following command:

  mkdir ~/resources
  cd ~/resources
  cp ~/Downloads/XResources4CIDD.txt .
  xrdb ./XResources4CIDD.txt

4. You can run CIDD directy from the command line
-------------------------------------------------

  CIDD -p http://front.eol.ucar.edu/content/projects/hawk/front/projDir/display/params/CIDD.front

5. Or you can download the start script
---------------------------------------

Go to:

  https://www.eol.ucar.edu/content/display-tools

Expand the "Files and Brochures' tab at the top.

Download the file:

  start_CIDD.front_.txt

Copy it into a bin directory:

  cd ~/bin
  cp ~/Downloads/start_CIDD.front_.txt start_CIDD.front

Make is executable:

  chmod +x start_CIDD.front

Run it:

  start_CIDD.front
